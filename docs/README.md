Solutions
Smart Cradle System using IOT.

It helps to the parent to monitor their child even if they are away from home and detect every activity of the baby from any distant corner of the world.

Motivation
Decrease the gap between parent and baby

To keep an eye on the baby while working , in a secure and safe manner.

To balance professional life and their babies life
